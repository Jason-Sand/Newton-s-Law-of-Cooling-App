# Newton's Law of Cooling App
Hey everybody! 

This is my first personal project and also my first time using GitHub. For this project I created an app with Python that utilizes Newton's Law of Cooling to determine the amount of time necesseary
for a cup of coffee to reach the user's desired temperature. It assumes a constant ambient temperature and no external sources of heating or cooling.

The app utilizes four user inputs, all of which are in degrees Celsius and are automatically converted to Kelvin. The inputs are the ambient temperature, initial temperature of the cup of coffee, 
the temperature after a minute, and the desired temperature. 

The user interface was created using Tkinter. It can handle user inputs and gives an error message in the event of user error.
